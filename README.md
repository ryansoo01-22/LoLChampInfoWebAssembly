# LoLChampInfoWebAssembly

This is a website that I made as a fun side project for myself to work with an API.

Originlly, I built this site using .NET Blazor Server and hosted it on the Azure Cloud. However, hosting it there incurred charges which I did not want to keep paying for, so I did some research and found a way to be able to host it for free! I turned the Blazor Server website into a Blazor WebAssembly website that is able to be hosted statically on GitHub Pages.
